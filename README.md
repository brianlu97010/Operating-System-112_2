# Operating-System-112_2
## Program Assignment 1
In this assignment you are to implement a Minix **shell** program.

## Program Assignment 2
The goal of this assignment is to get everyone up to speed on Minix OS and to gain some familiarity with scheduling. In this assignment you are to implement a **priority scheduler**. 
A priority scheduler assigns each process some number of lottery tickets, then randomly draws a ticket among those allocated to ready processes to decide which process to run. That process is allowed to run for a set time quantum, after which it is interrupted by a timer interrupt and the process is repeated.
