# OS program assignment 1

## To compile 
using `make` to run Makefile

## To execute
using `./ashell`

## To clean the executable file
using `make clean`


## Goal
Implement **shell built-in commands** (such as `cd`, `history`, `exit`) and **program commands** (such as `ls`, `grep`, etc. in the /bin/ directory).

### shell built-in commands
* Using `cd {directory}` to change directory.
* Using `history {n}` to displays your command line history.
* Using `exit` to exit the shell.

### program commands
* Using `ls` to  list directory contents
* Using `ls -a -l` to  list the files and directories within the current directory in a detailed format, including hidden files.
* Using 'pwd' to show current working directory.
* Using `grep` to fetch the word in line.

## Note
Haven't figured out how to complete  `&`, `>`, `>>`, `|`  yet.
